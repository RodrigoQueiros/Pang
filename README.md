Based on the game pang, created by Mitchell Corporation in 1989, we created our version using html canvas, css and javascript.
In addition to the game, we also created an svg animation for the intro of the game and a trailer developed in iMovie.

This project arose from the curricular unit of Graphic Animation belonging to the degree of Technologies and Information Systems for the Web at ESMAD.

## This repository contains:
* Pang magic code
* Intro svg code
* Trailer and original music
* 2 Reports of the project (in portuguese)
